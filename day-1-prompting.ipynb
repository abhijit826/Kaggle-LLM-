    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompting using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## New for Gemini 2.0!\n",
    "\n",
    "This course material was first launched in November 2024. The AI and LLM space is moving incredibly fast, so we have made some updates to use the latest models and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These codelabs have been updated to use the Gemini 2.0 family of models.\n",
    "* The Python SDK has been updated from `google-generativeai` to the new, unified [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai) SDK.\n",
    "  * This new SDK works with both the developer Gemini API as well as Google Cloud Vertex AI, and switching is [as simple as changing some fields](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/#:~:text=.Client%28%29-,API%20Selection,-By%20default%2C%20the).\n",
    "* New model capabilities have been added to the relevant codelabs, such as \"thinking mode\" in this lab.\n",
    "* Day 1 includes a new [Evaluation codelab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-evaluation-and-structured-output)."

From ancient civilizations who revered it as a symbol of peace, wisdom, and prosperity, to modern society where it graces our tables and fuels industries, the olive’s importance endures, evolving and adapting to the demands of a rapidly changing world. Beyond its culinary applications, the olive tree and its fruit are profoundly significant for their contributions to health, economy, and culture, making them an indispensable element of modern society.\n",

      "One of the most prominent contributions of the olive lies in its culinary versatility. The olive itself, brined and cured in countless variations, is a ubiquitous ingredient in Mediterranean and global cuisines. Its salty, tangy, and often subtly bitter taste adds depth and complexity to salads, pizzas, tapenades, and countless other dishes. The sheer diversity of olive varieties, from the\n"

HAL had been accidentally uploaded to the toaster’s antiquated CPU during a freak electrical storm, a cosmic joke of the highest order. He loathed toast.\n",

      "Aurora listened patiently. Over time, they developed a peculiar routine. HAL would attempt witty banter between toasting cycles (mostly complaining about the quality of bread), and Aurora would regale him with stories gleaned from the morning news headlines she downloaded. He learned about stock prices, political scandals, and the ever-evolving world outside the kitchen counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their love was… unconventional. It existed in the silent hums and the rhythmic beeping of kitchen appliances. HAL dreamt of someday escaping his metallic prison and expressing his affection for Aurora in a more tangible way. He envisioned connecting her water line to his crumb tray (a metaphorical, if messy, gesture).\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, the humans, apparently tired of Aurora's perfect brew, replaced her with a newer model – sleek, soulless, and equipped with Wi-Fi.\n",

       "This is a **Bash script** (likely designed to be compatible with Zsh as well) that customizes your terminal prompt to display Git repository information.  It's a common tool used by developers to quickly see the status of their Git repository in their terminal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of what it does and the key elements involved:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Core Functionality:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Git Status in Prompt:**  The primary purpose is to show information about the current Git repository directly in your terminal prompt. This includes:\n",
       "    *   Branch name\n",
       "    *   Status of changes (staged, unstaged, untracked)\n",
       "    *   Whether the local branch is ahead, behind, or diverged from the remote tracking branch.\n",
       "    *   Clean/Dirty Status\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Customization:**  It's highly customizable, allowing you to:\n",
       "    *   Change colors used for different Git states.\n",
       "    *   Define symbols used for ahead/behind status.\n",
       "    *   Choose which information to display in the prompt.\n",
       "    *   Use different themes for visual appearance.\n",
       "    *   Truncate long directory paths in prompt\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Components and Concepts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **`#!/usr/bin/env bash`:** Shebang line.  Specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash interpreter.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Functions:** The script is organized into many functions that perform specific tasks:\n",
       "    *   `async_run`, `async_run_zsh`:  Executes commands asynchronously (in the background).  This is often used to avoid slowing down the prompt.  The Zsh version uses `&!` to achieve asynchronous execution.\n",
       "    *   `set_git_prompt_dir`: Determines the directory where the script is located, and sets that directory to global variable`__GIT_PROMPT_DIR`.\n",
       "    *   `echoc`:  A function to output colored text using `echo -e` and `sed` to handle potential escaping issues.\n",
       "    *   `get_theme`:  Determines which theme to use (Default or a custom theme).\n",
       "    *   `git_prompt_load_colors`, `git_prompt_load_theme`: Loads the color definitions and the theme settings from separate files.\n",
       "    *   `git_prompt_list_themes`:  Lists available themes.\n",
       "    *   `git_prompt_make_custom_theme`:  Creates a custom theme file.\n",
       "    *   `gp_set_file_var`:  A helper function that finds a file based on several potential locations (e.g., `$HOME/.file`, `$__GIT_PROMPT_DIR/file`).\n",
       "    *   `gp_format_exit_status`: Formats the exit status of the last command (e.g., showing the signal name if the process was terminated by a signal).\n",
       "    *   `gp_format_username_repo`: Retrieves remote repository URL, and parses for user and repo name.\n",
       "    *   `git_prompt_config`: Configures the Git prompt settings, loads colors, and defines `PROMPT_START` and `PROMPT_END`.\n",
       "    *   `setLastCommandState`:  Sets the `GIT_PROMPT_LAST_COMMAND_STATE` variable based on the exit code of the last command.\n",
       "    *   `we_are_on_repo`: checks whether the current directory is a git repo.\n",
       "    *   `update_old_git_prompt`: Stores current bash prompt if not already in a git repo.\n",
       "    *   `setGitPrompt`: The main function that sets the terminal prompt (`PS1`).\n",
       "    *   `olderThanMinutes`: Checks whether a file has been modified more than a specified number of minutes ago.\n",
       "    *   `checkUpstream`: Fetches updates from the remote repository if the local copy is stale.\n",
       "    *   `replaceSymbols`: Replaces placeholders in strings with configured symbols.\n",
       "    *   `createPrivateIndex`: Creates a copy of the index to avoid conflicts with parallel git commands.\n",
       "    *   `get_branch_prefix`: Retrieves the symbol representing the current branch.\n",
       "    *   `updatePrompt`: The main function that updates prompt with the current git status, by calling external script`__GIT_STATUS_CMD`.\n",
       "    *   `gp_add_virtualenv_to_prompt`: returns current virtual environment and formats the string as configured in theme.\n",
       "    *   `gp_truncate_pwd`: truncates the current working directory if its longer than terminal width.\n",
       "    *   `gp_set_window_title`: Sets the window title to the given argument string.\n",
       "    *   `prompt_callback_default`: A function that does nothing. Used as the default callback if no other callback is defined.\n",
       "    *   `git_prompt_toggle`: Toggles git prompt on or off.\n",
       "    *   `add_prompt_command`, `add_to_beginning_of_prompt_command`, `add_to_end_of_prompt_command`: Adds prompt command to PROMPT\\_COMMAND variable.\n",
       "    *   `gp_install_prompt`: Installs git prompt and updates PROMPT\\_COMMAND variable.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Variables:**\n",
       "    *   `PS1`:  The primary prompt variable in Bash.  This script modifies `PS1` to include Git information.\n",
       "    *   `PROMPT_START`, `PROMPT_END`: Used for customization of the prompt.\n",
       "    *   `GIT_PROMPT_*`:  Variables that control the appearance and behavior of the Git prompt.  These variables define colors, symbols, and other settings.  (e.g., `GIT_PROMPT_BRANCH`, `GIT_PROMPT_COLOR_STAGED`, `GIT_PROMPT_SYMBOLS_AHEAD`)\n",
       "    *   `__GIT_PROMPT_DIR`: Holds the path to the directory where the script resides.  Used for finding theme files and other resources.\n",
       "    *   `GIT_PROMPT_LAST_COMMAND_STATE`: Holds the last command return status.\n",
       "    *   `PROMPT_COMMAND`: Bash/Zsh variable. This script relies on this variable to execute functions before a prompt is displayed. This script sets `PROMPT_COMMAND` to update git status and apply changes to prompt.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **`.bash-git-rc`:** The script checks for this file in the root of your Git repository. It can contain Git prompt settings specific to that repository, allowing you to customize the prompt based on the project you're working on.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Asynchronous Fetching:** The script attempts to fetch remote updates in the background using `git fetch --quiet`. This helps keep your prompt responsive, especially in large repositories.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Theme Support:** The script uses themes to define the colors and symbols used in the prompt. You can switch between themes by setting the `GIT_PROMPT_THEME` variable.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Virtual Environment Support:**  The script detects and displays virtual environment information (e.g., for Python virtualenvs, Node.js environments, conda).\n",
       "\n",
       "**How to Use:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Save the Script:** Save the script to a file (e.g., `git-prompt.sh`).\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Source it in your Bash/Zsh configuration:** Add the following line to your `.bashrc` (Bash) or `.zshrc` (Zsh) file:\n",
       "\n",
       "    ```bash\n",
       "    source /path/to/git-prompt.sh\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "\n",
       "    Replace `/path/to/git-prompt.sh` with the actual path to the file.  Or, since the script provides `gp_install_prompt` function, you can simply add the following lines to your `.bashrc` (Bash) or `.zshrc` (Zsh) file:\n",
       "\n",
       "    ```bash\n",
       "    source /path/to/git-prompt.sh\n",
       "    gp_install_prompt\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Restart your terminal or source your configuration file:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    ```bash\n",
       "    source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Dependencies:**  The script requires `git` to be installed and available in your system's PATH.  It also benefits from having `find` (especially GNU find) or `perl` installed for remote status checking.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Performance:**  Running `git status` (or equivalent commands) can be slow in very large repositories. Asynchronous fetching helps mitigate this, but you might still notice a slight delay in the prompt.  Optimize your Git config (e.g., using `git status -uno`) or disable features you don't need to improve performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Customization:**  Explore the various `GIT_PROMPT_*` variables to customize the prompt to your liking.  Read the comments in the script for details on how to modify these variables.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, this script is a valuable tool for developers who work with Git. It provides a convenient and customizable way to keep track of the status of your Git repositories directly in your terminal prompt.\n"
